# Welcome to Conservative Technology Group

Let's discover **Conservative Technology Group in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **learning about our mission and joining our meetings**.

Or **explore our website immediately** by navigating through the different sections.

### What you'll find here

- **Mission**: Learn about our commitment to government transparency
- **Meetings**: Watch recorded meetings and access meeting notes
- **Schedule**: View upcoming events and biannual gatherings
- **About**: Understand our approach and focus areas

## Our Mission

We individually are supporting various projects related to government transparency. While these are generally passion projects that we would do for free, it would be nice to get collaboration across many similar projects to help push forward.

For that purpose, we have decided to start meeting in person. Possible outcome could be to form a nonprofit organization to help with organizing and supporting projects.
