# CTG AmericaFest 2025

## Event Overview

**Date:** 17 Dec 2025  
**Location:** TBD  
**Duration:** 1 day
**Purpose:** Strategic planning session for DOGE related projects  

## Event Details

AmericaFest 2025 will be our spring biannual gathering for the Conservative Technology Group. This face-to-face event will focus on strategic planning for government transparency projects and setting priorities for the next 6 months.

### Tentative Schedule Day 1, 17 Dec 2025

#### Overview
- breakfast
- welcome talk
- talk blocks
- breakout talks

#### Welcome: 20m Sean and Team will introduce the event

#### talk block one
  - 15m Sean: Discuss, plan next 6m of projects
    - California DOGE, Kansas, New Hampshire, Michigan, Hawaii, Palisades Project, and DOT works. 

#### talk block two/ fireside chats
  - 40m Pierce, (guest TBD): **Fighting Government Censorship**, We came dangerously close to losing the ability to speak over the past 5+ years. Governments, NGOs, and companies conspired to put limits on speech and thought. Lucky for the US, we can still organize to fight and argue. I see our technology focus as a way to enshrine those principles. Our rights come from the creator, not government. It is our duty to be vigilant and defend those rights.
  - 40m (guest TBD) **How a Cartoon Mobilized a Generation**, the story behind Dilbert and how it showed conservative tech bros that they were not alone. 

#### 20m break

#### talk block three
  - 40m Steven, others: **Open Government Data List**, gathering all the unstructured data sources FOIAable government data, local, regional, state, and federal and making the list available raw for the public, researchers and reporters. data.gov foia.gov, directory.civictech.guide, and others provide some lists, but not complete. This list will be comprehensive. 
  - 40m (guest TBD) **Grassroots Organizing**, how to mobilize your friends and neighbors to work towards a common goal. Defending free speech and organizing to expose corruption requires a lot of work. Lets break down how anyone can do this. 
  - 40m Sean, (guest TBD): **Department of Open Data (DOOD)**, the data pipeline for the Open Government Data List. Use the data list as the unstructured data source for many data pipelines to Extract Transform and Load (ETL) on a regular schedule. The ETL processes will make the data available for any open data, research or investigative projects to process. It will also follow a common standard like CKAN, so that all the data sets are easily processed. this is an objective that nontech people can get behind and fund  

#### 90m lunch

#### 3hr breakout topic ideas so far
  - Gathering all the unstructured data sources FOIAable government data, local, regional, state, and federal and making the list available raw for the public, researchers and reporters
