It is a appropriate time to talk about why we are working towards meeting in person. We came dangerously close to losing the ability to speak over the past 5+ years. Governments, NGOs, and companies conspired to put limits on speech and thought. Lucky for the US, we can still organize to fight and argue. I see our technology focus as a way to enshrine those principles. Our rights come from the creator, not government. It is our duty to be vigilant and defend those rights. 

With that, I created a mission statement last week that nonprofit partners can support and I wanted to get feedback: We develop tools related to government transparency and for the public good. We implement ETL and data standards to facilitate many data sources correlation so that timely research can be turned into action. Our goal is to apply the tools and implementation to make data accessible from local, regional, and national sources.

Thank you everyone for your contributions. I very much look forward to be part of what we can create together.
