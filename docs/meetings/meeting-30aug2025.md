## transcript

Uh there it goes. Okay. Um so uh I'll try to let anybody else in. Apparently we're having problems with folks joining by laptop. Um it's weird. So uh we'll try to work that out separately, but uh got enough people that's joined so far. Um, so I'm going to go off the um try to be

try to try to be a little bit more organized than maybe I have in the past. So I'm going to um drop the meeting agenda into the chat. Um we don't have to go off the meeting agenda religiously, but it was more just to keep me on track. So I rambled a little little bit less. Um, so certainly guys jump in if there's something you wanted to add or um you think it's a more of a priority um while I'm talking away. So uh so this is the August 30th um generically. Hey Shell. Um so uh the purpose of this meeting is generically to discuss uh getting folks together um in America Fest on on or around the 17th in Phoenix. Um this is right before the event starts. Um there's three days 18th to the 21st in Phoenix I believe at the Phoenix Convention Center. Um and so individually we've been working on projects both you know media related um data related and presenting them to folks uh you know users I guess you could say out the general public and uh um we had the bright idea of getting together face to face and um so far the 17th before the event the formal American Fest starts seems like a good time we haven't figured out a place um and so this is kind of the logistic or uh the dirty bits of trying to figure that stuff out and try to see if we can have a quorum of where, when, how, and uh and then maybe, you know, coordinate having some fun over, you know, attending some of the um meetings and meeting some people during Americ

wants to I just made I just posted the link on X to get more people join it. Cool. Yeah, it's it's all good. Um

yeah, I threw out strategic invites too via I told them to visit the website. I g I didn't give them the direct link because I thought if you're going to visit the website and I'm calling in favors for people that might be interested. I'm like you need to check this out. You need to check this out this out. you know, just from listening to different people in spaces, whether they're a developer on the administrative side, production side, builder side, researcher side, whatever. Hey, cool. So, uh, so anybody that just joined, um, go ahead and take a look at the chat. Hopefully the chat is visible for everyone. Um, it is. I'm commenting. They joined. Oh, he dropped. Oh, whatever. Uh so um so uh any anybody's thoughts on what I talked about so far? Does that seem still on track for everyone? You know, meeting at the meeting 17th before the thing starts. Um you know, does that sound tactically like the right thing to do? Um anybody else that you that couldn't join have any other ideas or or wanted to join us? What do you guys think? I don't know. We We need We just need to start advertising it so we can get a group of people. Sure. And I purposely actually uh just to see if we can get a few of us to discuss it before there was like a flood of different ideas. is it I think the people at least somewhat represented on this call represent people that are doing stuff you know like either holding X spaces or uh building building tools um so um once we start advertising which is certainly what I want it to do we'll get a lot more people that are talkers rather than doers which is fine but um it it could get a little distracting so I wanted to see if we get a little bit of a direction before that Thank you for saying that. And if I could just jump in there and piggyback. So my main focus is like behind the scenes getting people to who do host spaces that want to host a particular space around this, you know. Um, and I'm willing to to fill in the gap, but I'm mainly wanting to pound out like fonts and branding and stuff like that because with the post that will come too and especially with the America Fest. But also with that the administrative uh reaching doing the research and I need the America Fest website again because I'm looking at trying to get tickets seeing who might want to fund or whatever and you know they say desperate times call for desperate measures. I don't think that it will come to this but I've already been making plans of how much money would I need to save this month to be able to or what would I give up to be able to make this. So, I believe that you can count us in for two tickets. Um, you know, if we're not able to raise the money, but I think that we will be able to. And Stephen is right on point. So, it shell that we have to get this marketing out there. So, if they want to run with it, I'll just follow behind them with the artwork, the videos, but you got to communicate. I I if I if nobody's getting back to anybody or they can't send a headsh shot because they're busy doing something, it takes like five seconds to do that. So, I'm all in on doing the branding, posting. I'm the repost queen. Y'all let me know what you need. Right now, I'm, you know, I feel like Sean has a certain vision. We all have a certain vision. I was looking at your profile going, "Okay, this is what it's about. Bringing people together and organizing it in a way to where it's simplified to where the information like Aladdin has a great his post threads. I mean a lot of great information stuff that's like wow you know and so my main focus is the media side of it the podcasters all of that and we just need to figure out a way to streamline until people are able to branch out in their perspective states so that's all I got

um I was going to say something Hold on give me a second to get my thought back no it's all good no pressure um oh I remember now. Regina, are you in our beta chat or group beta chat?

I don't Stephen, I don't know if you are. And Pierce, I don't think you are either. I I will add all beta chat. You mean the Yes. Our Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, I don't think they Hold on. The beta chat only works on Apple products. Oh, you don't have Apple? Okay. Um No, I do. I do have my my phone is Apple, but what kind of phone? Hold on a second. Can we take a time out for a second? Just a timeout. So, yeah. No, I'm cool with that. I'm cool with that. So, here's my thing. I'm trying to learn GitHub right now and trying to learn how to do like submission forms on the website. Um, I don't mind getting into like a community chat, but I normally don't because when I get into it, I want to keep up with everyone and get to know everyone if this is something that will be beneficial and it's something that I can add to help out with, assist. I just right now I'm at a crossroads where I'm having to make decisions with my time and I am committed to this. I'm just committed to it. Like Sean, you know, if if he's going to be there, if you're going to be there, Aladdin's going to be there. Pierce the core group. And I think that's what Sean was saying, like if we start bringing in too many at one time, everything's going to kind of get lost a little bit. So, I was more interested when you had mentioned admin and stuff like that. I wanted to hear what you thought. Like you and and Stephen seem to be on the same page as we are, like we could be like the effective marketing team. So, um, and you've got this beta chat. You're here, and that's the goal to get it everywhere. Yet, at the same time, the goal right now, because December is not that far away, is to get to America Fest. Is anyone even interested in going to America Fest? What is America Fest? So, my goal is just doing all that generic stuff. And Sean, I need you to email me that video. I tried to download it from my phone and whatever. It wouldn't give me a choice. So, so do that. But like um Okay. So, yeah, just I wanted to hear Shelle what what because I want to get to know you and stuff and I'm going to get to know you through the X platform the more we interact and the more meetings we attend with each other. But what did you have in mind? Like you were talking about the marketing. So, I want to hear what you had in mind. I just want us all to be on the same page and I want us to like Stephen was talking about, you know, just promote what we're trying to do. get as many people to, you know, um, come along with us, so to speak. I just think this is great what Sean wants to do. And, um, I don't have a set, um, what was I going to say? I'm sorry. I am like my brain is No, you're good. Just I'm on vacation right now, so I'm I have vacation brain. Tell us. Listen, just give us your back story. Tell us how you got how you met Sean, how you met Stephen, if you met any of them. Uh tell us what your platform is about and maybe we will see skills that you don't necessarily see. You know, it's hard when you're asked to pitch yourself or say, "Hey, you know, what did you want?" And we did put you on the spot and we thank you for coming when you're on vacation, girl, because I don't know that I would have shown up on vacation. Well, I care about Well, me and Sean have been pretty good friends and same with me and Stephen. I just started talking with Pierce. Um I met him through Gardner. Um and then Okay, so Patriot Dad and Gardner and I we all met like at the same time. We were in um you know those follow trains or whatever that we have. We ended up being in there together and we all just clicked and we've been best buddies ever since. Um uh yeah. Um, I originally came on here because cuz my son, um, he's on X as well. And he's like, "Mom, you really need to stop watching mainstream media." I'm like, "Okay, fine." He's like, "Go on X. That's where all you know, all the uh truth is." And I was like, "Okay." So, that's originally what I came on here for. Then I met Gardner and Patriot Dad and I was like, "Oh, okay." And then I met more people and then I got into AI. That's basically my thing right now. Um is my AI art. I don't know if you guys have seen on my page the quote tweets and stuff that I've been doing with my friends. I'm going to your page right now, my lady. I absolutely I don't know. I I'm really into that. Um I do want to help with this Doge stuff, too. Um there's so much fraud, waste, abuse everywhere. I really want to get into Michigan myself. I want to start diving deep into Michigan because I know that there's there's a bunch of BS going on here, too. Um, which Michelle Bigalow are you? Which Michelle Bigalow? Yeah, I got three. You got three? How do you have three? Uh, just my email for all of you is Titan Shell. I do. Yeah, I have three different emails. I do too. I have Bible Beginning 16, which is what my YouTube channel is under. I have West Virginia Wire when I changed when I rebranded from just my name, Regina Connell. And then I also have just my name, Regina Connell. But I've been trying to divert everything like this related to West Virginia, no spam, stuff like that. So I I have multiple, too. I don't like it. It's a lot to keep up with, right? Yeah. The Titan Shell um email Pierce. Okay. Maybe not sure which Michelle Bigalow you're in an X. Oh. Oh, my uh my handle is Titan Shell on X too. Titan Shell. Okay. 42069. Yes. Thank you. Titan Shell 42069. Pierce, we're already following. Okay. Yeah. Yep. Yes. Oh, ton of notifications there. So, maybe stop me if I'm jumping ahead too fast. Um, maybe a good segue is to talk about um and this probably would be a good advertisement as well. um that uh um Gardner um uh I guess in co um that administer the um the team doge community which has a sizable audience. Um I assume most of them aren't technical. They're more interested in the the results of uh making government more efficient not um doing something uh perhaps directly about it. Um so um is said that quotequote we have permission from the I guess the admins um that run that that group um or that community more accurate on on act. So um midepptember is uh been generically the the time that uh we've agreed to and um Gardner is asking that we provide um a set agenda about two weeks before we're scheduled to talk and you know obviously he'd hope that we stick to it. We haven't specifically talked about uh how long. Um I assume probably about an hour but not sure. Um that's something probably I should nail down. Um but um I I thought it would be a good time for us to uh and uh maybe directly um shill for getting people to um join us in America at America Fest for this event is to tie those two things together and maybe talk about one or two government efficiency like um topics. And we could do the this maybe the simple maybe oversimplistic is just to talk about one or two of our projects and then to also talk about meeting face to face in America fest um or or maybe an and um probably don't want to pick too many things at least for this first um event um or this first X space I should say. um we could talk about uh one or two of the topics that um that uh uh for America Fest. So I've picked you know intentionally tried to pick some things or put some things out there as ideas. So like AI regulation um you know both state and federal or that or might be interesting might be kind of dry for some folks who aren't into technology. um state of open data in the US. I'm just picking some random ones. Um uh that's where your media team will come in to make things a little sexier for the person that maybe that's not their thing. I'll have visual aid. Keep this honest. Yes. Stay broad on topic. I say shoot for a an hour and a half, right? And sketch out. You know, you're really good at organization. Shell and I, whoever is going to be speakers, co-hosts, we need definitive roles. We need someone in the comment section pinning things as you're talking about them. So, I'm great at that. Um, and let's plan to live stream that, too, because we want it on every platform. Um, and like I said, I'm going to be working on the back end of editing little packages to do. So, it's going to be fun. And Stephen kind of knows how I operate. He's like, "Don't be so hard on me." I'm like, "That's the job of a producer. I have to be hard on you. It's show time. People don't care if we ain't got our [ __ ] together. We got to act like we got our [ __ ] together. You act like it long enough, then eventually you're actually doing it. So that's a how we started till you make it, right?

So, um, one of the other topics could be, um, um, I've talked somewhat more, uh, like three topics, Sean, three topics. One is America first, two projects where you start out with your intros, who is everybody, the main two topics that you're highlighting, and then, of course, your topic is America Fest. That's your main project right now. Okay. getting people to America Fest plus everything else you do building up to America Fest that stuff will come in organically. Then whatever projects you were deciding like if Stephen wants to talk about what he and Jennica are doing whatever. So uh narrow it down to the body is three hardcore segments other than your intro of what America First is. So if you want to say hey this is about getting to America first. We're going to break down these three topics after intros. I mean, we're gonna have Rocky style music playing at the beginning. We're going all in. All right. Um Okay. So, I Yeah, I think that's that makes sense. Um that would be more on topic, I guess, what we think is important right now. So, just to um so spend 10 15 minutes talking about America Fest, why we're why we want to get there, um who's invited, um and then two topics that maybe we would talk about at America Fest. Do your W's. What, when, who, why, why is it important to go to America Fest? Why is it important to be a part of this movement? What is this movement? Who is this movement? Where is this movement? If you could fulfill those W's, it'll help keep you. Yeah. Okay, sounds good. Um, so spend 10 15 minutes talking about America Fest and then break up the rest of the time talking about um two topics that we'll highlight at America Fest or focus on, I should say, drill down. So, does that sound generically good to everyone? And what would the if so what would be those two topics? I can work with that. What's that? I said I can work with that. Shell, can you work with that? I can work with that. I can work with that, too. Gina's Gina and Shell are keeping us honest. So, what do you guys What do you all think? What are the two? And this is for everyone. What do you think would be the two if we h if somebody put a gun to our heads and said, you know, come up with two topics that are going to dominate the American Fest face to face, what would those be? Yeah. And before you do that, you said about the second week of September. So, uh I'm not sure that I would want to keep it this Saturday date. I don't know. Y'all have to decide on that, but I say the week of the 16th, like from the 10th to the 16th. see if we can jump in because there's a lot of background work to do. But I will just follow y'all's lead. So, uh, establish the date, the time when we can, but go ahead and hammer out these topics because I'm taking notes as you're talking. Yeah, I don't think it should be the same. Uh, the the date and time of the X space should not be the same as this. This is different. This is like a a planning. So, um, I leave it to the broader group of people that know this better than I. What would be the ideal time to hold a space to gather, you know, as much of the Doge community audience? I think do a poll. Stephen's great at doing Let's do a poll. Stephen's great at doing polls. We could try to do that. Direct people to the website. And also, I found it easier if you give people a choice of like three and then we have to remember Pacific to Eastern. So, if we could do middle of the road, I think that's just my suggestion. Anybody else chime in? I agree with you, Regina, because I'm Eastern. I don't know about you guys. Me and Patriot Dad are eastern. Yeah, I'm m I'm Pacific. Yeah, Pierce and I are on the the left coast. Um, so yeah, I'm flexible. I can do it pretty much whenever. Um, so the most audience can get better. Yeah, Stephen's schedule is the one that um I really want to, you know, try to work around, but you said it kind of shifts. But remember, if Stephen can't make it, we're representing Stephen. So, if there's a project that Stephen's got going on and he wasn't able to make it because he's got some covert operation he's working on, then that's when, hey, I know about his project or Shell knows about his project enough to say, hey, he couldn't be here tonight, but no worries, we got him covered. you know, so uh we'll always be able to fill in the gap and I think all of us are pretty good at pivoting. So, you know, uh let's let's hammer out these topics which I want to talk about. Go ahead, Sean. Go. All right. Sounds sounds good. Uh Stephen, um I think you've told me probably 20 times at this point, but if if I can repeat it back that really the only time that you're consistently available is going to be like Saturday morning this time to like the afternoon. Is that accurate? Uh, well, Saturday anytime if I don't have anything going on, but usually Saturdays are my free time, right? Yeah. Yeah. I'm not sure. Yeah. Well, we'll just take that into account and see if we can accommodate your schedule and Okay. So, let's do what the community wants to do. Let's do this. Stephen, I need you to look at your calendar right now, the second week of September, right? And this is just just we got to start somewhere a point. So from the 15th to the 19th or the second week, right? We need two weeks to get it out. They need do they need the actual content and preview it or do they just need two weeks notice with the outline of it, Sean? Yeah, it's a good question. Um I don't think we were that specific. I think it was Don't worry about it. I'll have it all. Let's schedule for the la the third week. Let's schedule for the 22nd through the 26th. Let's figure it out. Stephen, if you're not able to make it, we'll make sure you're represented. Everybody knows you're a part of this, right? So, um, yeah, definitely. Stephen, I think it's too confusing if we do it on a Saturday because people will confuse the Google Meet with the X no matter how many times you tell them, unless we make it like way away from each other, which I don't know how that's possible. Well, we could do it Saturday, you know, late afternoon. We could, which hit, you know, maybe the sweet spot for East Coasters, like I will say something like that. So, yeah. I will say this though, like Stephen, you got to take into account that people spend time with their families. We are headed into the winter months, which is good for us. We could use that to our advantage because most people will be staying inside and probably be on spaces more. Um, just if you could commit to making one of those Saturday X space with the Doge because you're so hugely connected with the Doge, but like people know who you are. So, um, you know, you're represented on this. So, just let us know and we got to start planning for it and pick the date and then let's get the topics down. So, are you comfortable like if you have a project you want to bring to the table, but you're not able to someone repping your your topic because I think for the first one we just need to get the topics down and they're America Fest related. So, what project would you want to showcase at America Fest? Like Sean, his thing is, you know, bringing everybody together, you know, the GitHub thing, the website thing. Pierce is a developer. Michelle is got her thing. I got my thing. So, uh, let's hatch out these two topics. Sounds good. Yeah. So, I'm I'm available 13 20th. Those falls on Saturdays in September. And, uh, the projects for me at America First, I can teach people how to use US spending and FPDS databases. That way, that way if any individual out there is have a free time, they can sniff through those two spending databases on the federal level. But also, we can compile uh some sort of a a list of every state spending databases because those are not going to be FPDS and USA spending. So each state they have their own uh uh websites or databases and if we can figure out I can sh I'm in Colorado right now so I can probably figure this out for Colorado and maybe a couple other spaces and uh we can just upload those links into the Google doc. Sweet. Yeah, I like that a lot. Um yeah, so that way when we go to America Fest and be like, "Hey, where do you live at?" Uh Texas. Okay, here's your starting point. Yeah, here's here's your state spending databases. You can sniff through and see where the state level uh spending at and and uh and if there's waste or any suspicious activities or spending, they can share that in public spaces or post it on X and whatnot and we can retweet it and [ __ ] like that. What we need to do, we need to build, you know, like the Doge community, we need to build our community and we start adding people in that way. Yeah. That way when our ranks grows uh those people, they can post in our community uh instead of going elsewhere like it. Okay. So, if you were to hold on one second, Sean, I'm sorry. If you were to give your topic a title, like I were to put it into a prompt as a G chat GPT, what you just descri You know what? I'm going to wait and see what the notes does on it. What's that notes creator thing that does the little notes that you the re What's it called that after the meeting it puts it in like little notes and summaries? Uh you mean the transcriber? Yeah, it transcriber and the little thing. I'll go back and watch that and I'll send Yeah. So, if you were to put You mean um uh Yeah, it we didn't have um We didn't have that. Uh that wasn't one of ours. That was um Oh, okay. One of the other guys. You notice that he the bot didn't join auto. That was called auto. Yes. Auto auto. Yeah. You know, I probably should um either uh have Otter um or something similar join or I should um start um I've been threatening to transcribe um the meetings. It's supposed to happen automatically. It doesn't seem to be working. It would help me with editing, too. It would be very helpful. Is it a monthly subscription cost for the otter? Uh there can be. Um, let me I'll I'll take that on and um take on the responsibility for that and look into it. So that um can we make one of the topics financial like getting money fundraising? Make it three topics in the body for an hour and a half, right? The first 15 minutes, intros, all of that. Then you got your outros. Let's do Stephen's topic. We'll figure out a nice neat bullet point for it. And then your topic with the um you know let's talk about the finances. We got to start directing people. We'll talk about um yeah I think raising money for like maybe close out the last five 10 minutes of that conversation talking about fundraising or we could put it up front wherever you guys think would be more appropriate. I mean you got to put it in their faces front, middle and end, right? And so when you when you say, "Hey, we have a way for you to support." Don't, you know, just lead out with, "We have a way for you to support. Let me tell you what you're supporting." Don't tell them how to support. Then midway through, if you like what you're hearing, check out. And then we'll direct them to your cash, you know, your your Yeah. And then we'll close with now, you know, any of you still on the fence, join our Google meetings. that we highly want people some people will just want to throw money at it and be done with it you know but through that we'll meet people that will want to be active so the first one of the topics is Stephen's topic you uh then we'll talk about the finances and then the well no we're going to handle that so so the other two topics what are the other two topics more in depth what's needed to get to America Fest and then what you're actually doing on the website Stephen is one What are you teaching people? What is Pierce doing? What is Shell doing? Like everybody what do you and Shell think? You know what would if if I was to ask you to um talk about something during the America Fest, what would you want to talk about?

Man, what do you think? Sh.

You're muted. Okay. Yes, I know. I'm sorry. Yeah, it's all right. Um I have to think on that one, Sean. Okay, no problem. Yeah, no problem. You You've got vacation brain. What do you think? You want me to tell you what I would talk about? Please, please. Yes, please. I would talk about the importance of networking. Uh how social media, web two can also play into web three, the importance of getting together and starting locally in our communities. while we can be attentive to the things that are happening nationally until we fully come together. So I probably do about a I don't know three to five minutes something on that you know I could probably talk for that long I don't know that would cue I probably speak on it for about two to three minute two minutes a minute and a half two three minutes and then take questions the next two three minutes. Okay. See I'm good at like what Regina does like the marketing and stuff. That's what I kind of want to help with. I want to help you with that. Yeah. I'm not going to force anybody to speak. I was just trying to get opinions. So I think No, I still want to think of a topic too, Sean. I'm not gonna not think of one. I just right now I just wanted to put that up there to let her know that I'm on her side. Yeah, we'll be communicating on back channels. Titan and I because we may even be able to tag team it, you know, like we're both she's got gifts on, you know, probably knows way more about Twitter and the Xplatform and we'll, you know, she knows other stuff that I don't know. So, that's what we're all trying to learn. And that's the whole basic. It's not just the, you know, hey, it's not about if you're interested in what your governor is doing, you know, but there are people that are doing that that need to free up their time to dig into what the governor is doing. And that's where we come in. Awesome. Pierce, what would uh what would be your your topic for America Fest that we could briefly talk about during this upcoming X space? Uh I'm going to name it vibe doing. And that's like using Grock or an AI to start parsing through government data. Vibe doing. Wow, look at you. That's awesome. Yeah. I mean, I'll have to make a presentation and stuff, but you know, it'll be like like it bring your laptop and your X account and uh let's grind through some data. And what's the name of it again? I want to throw out a vote for like what I should work on next for the Seni. Nice. Okay. What was the name of it? What did he say the name of it was? Vibe Doing. Vibe Doging. Look, I got one, too. I could do a specific I got somebody I'm in talks with somebody about doing I never thought I would do training courses. Lord help me. But anyway, uh I'm going to call it meet me in the yard. Meet me in the yard and it's going to be on streaming services. I'm the first episode's going to be comparing OBS to Streamyard to all of that. So that should always be something too.

I like that a lot. Um I like that too. Yeah. And um uh maybe Michelle could do um vibe memeing.

Vibe everything. Oh, by the way, Michelle, I sent you an art request because I was trying to get Grock to draw it this morning and it refused to to do it. So, no, it didn't refuse to do it. It just it exhausted my patience. Hi, guys. Send it in. Okay. We also need we also need a good name for the space like a catchy name where people will make them join. So somebody creative catchy name I like it. Uh no that's for the episodes. We got to keep with the same Doge Network Cali Doge underneath Sean for all of that somehow. But the catchy as far as the space, yes, we'll have the space name, but it needs to involve the whole whatever. But I will come up with episode names, no problem. Catch me, like you said. And Stephen, throw me any ideas you have, please. I don't have any imagination because I never watched. Sorry about that. Also, that or what is that? I never watched Star Wars. So my imagination is like zero. We watch Star Trek. Everything gets um replicated for us. Yeah, I've never watched that either. So how long have you been in America? What kind of American I am?

Not sure Star Trek is required for uh an American to watch. You should be. No, I'm just kidding. All right. All right. Let's get back on track, you guys. Titan Shell is on vacation. Sean, we've I'm sorry. I think we've gotten a lot of great stuff here. I can't wait to go back and watch the record and put this stuff together. So, we decided uh on topics, right? Yeah, I I think so. Um and the topic I would want to speak about is is very uh similar to what um Stephen's talking about which is um developing um a broader national from uh starting cities, counties, states and federal and starting uh break up into focus areas but all somewhat uh cheating off each other as far as um how we're doing it and uh and kind of the reason why we're doing it. So yeah, that that would be very similar to what I would want to to do at America Fest. So I think that's fantastic because it's a great segue. Uh you know, you start out or Stephen starts out, then you come in, you guys uh it'll keep everybody on track that, you know, I love the idea. So, we got to think of a title of that and a title of Stevens and then Pierce, you're going to come in with your Doge Mine thing. All right, let's do it. So, that's our three topics. So, what's our date and time? Well, oh, I'm sorry. What are three topics? So, um, talk about how to, uh, I I think I understood the last one because I was already thinking about it, which is, um, uh, vibe doing makes some sense to me because vibe coding, it's a play off those words. So, I think that's super cool. Um, and then, uh, the Steen and I are talking about, you know, uh, building kind of a the larger community of people focused on local issues, but using kind of the the national um, tools, I guess, or the bigger. So, just rep just rep whatever community you're strongest in. Doge, rep your state. And then Stephen, he's got a different kind of uh we'll figure out um what to rep it um and how what makes your projects different yet similar. So we just need to think of a great title and then y'all just spin your project. Okay. Um and what would be the third topic? So your one topic, your project even though it's similar to Stephen. So you just describe how you're working on the same thing kind of but y'all are different. You know what I mean? But you're on the same website. You're going to America first. So your project is your project. Whatever you're building, whatever Stephen's doing is his project even but you have the same. So you talk about what you're specifically working on which is America first Doge network all of that. Then Stephen will come in and bring his contribution as to how it plays into this. So whatever we come up with the topic. Didn't you I mean y'all describe the same thing but you're taking different approaches, right? Well, let me let me restate it. Hopefully this makes more sense. So um if I was to simplify what I think Stephen and I are talking about is building the Doge local, state national data sources. Um and then um and just kind of leave it simple like that. And then um obviously if we do that then people want to sign up for something similar. So keep it to two topic. Pierces vibing go my you and Stephen take a longer time slot to tag team. So you have like a co-host type like two people talking. I don't think we have to take longer. I think we give each other equal time on right. You bounce off of each other and that will bring a different dynamic to the space also. So you'll have the segment where you and Stephen are talking about that. Uh Pierce, if you're comfortable going first, we'll let you go first or let him go last, whatever, because everybody's going to be interested in the AI aspect. So whoever goes first, the room's still going to be filling up after intros and stuff. So, you know, let PICE go first, then you and then Kiten Shell and I will come up with the third topic, the social media aspect of it. The importance of commenting, the importance of sharing out, the importance of joining a community, the importance of going to the website. So, you and Stephen are tag teaming. You're going to have a 15 minute slot, right? And then Pierce, you'll have a five minute slot, but be prepared to go over, be prepared to take questions. Titan Shell and I will figure out our Let's each take a 15 minute slot. That's 15, 30, 45 minutes. Let's each take a 15 minute slot, right? And Pierce, I also work with AI as well. So, if you need someone to jump in, but I think Pierce will do great solo. Uh, we each have our different highlights. So, y'all are a buddy system. She and I are a buddy system. Pierce, if you want to bring a buddy, bring a buddy. So, we're doing the Doge. You and I will come up with a cool title. And then, are we good on that? That's our three-part. Yeah, I that sounds good to me. What do you got? You guys all like that. I'm on board 100%. Five dozing, building the national or the local to national data sources and social media kind of. Okay, cool. Um, well done team. Very proud of us. Feel like we accomplished something. Um, so I wanted to be respectful of everyone's time. Um, we've already we've been at this for about 45 minutesish. Started a little bit late. Um, something that's been on the agenda, but we don't necessarily have to um solve today. And maybe um we talked about bookending our topics with uh you know fundraising comments. Um so um Regina had uh smartly brought up that we should uh book um a block of hotel rooms. Um at the very least it would make it more likely that we'd all be in one place. So, if we do get a conference room, let's say at a hotel, um before the actual um uh events of America Fest start, it's more likely that we'd all be able to join easily and we wouldn't have, you know, travel problems because it'll probably be somewhat of a nightmare. U people getting around a couple days before, there'll be a lot of people moving around because of the event. Uh so, so yeah. Um, so, uh, I'll I'll make an effort. There's two hotels that are formally, um, part of America Fest, but I imagine there's probably five or 10 others that are interesting that are in the area. Might even be some Airbnb options. Um, I'm good with either. Um, either an Airbnb or um, a hotel room. So, just let us know, I guess. Yeah. Well, one of the things maybe we don't know each other quite that well yet, but um one of the things I've done large groups is to actually get um you know a large uh Airbnb that can hold like 15 to 20 people. Um I'm not sure if we're ready to bunk bed it with Well, hold on a second. Can I can I interject something here? I agree with you. I think the core people should maybe do the Airbnb, right? Okay. And it could be cheaper. Plus, the Airbnb will provide for the equipment that I'm bringing because we'll need that studio space if that's still the objective. Put your cigarette away, man. I'm waiting for Rusty to bring me my cigarettes. I'm out. No, I'm just kidding. Give me a Give me a puff of that cigarette. Anyway, sorry. Falling apart. She doesn't have I dig. I got distracted. So, let's let's focus because I think an Airbnb might be a little bit cheaper. How many rooms do we need? It could be. I mean, I think that it would be, but if we can also book hotel, you know, everybody will book their own hotel, whatever. But the core people I think the core people that are doing this and stick with this, we should do an Airbnb because uh and find out. I'll take on that. And remember, we're getting tickets for America Fest, too. Even if it's just us, even if I have to get you a ticket for you to go in there to make connections, like we have to divide and conquer. if we have to, if we don't have the money. I'm all about doing [ __ ] for free, so I'll do what I can. And um let's Well, I mean, it's not like we're not doing some work. And if we're organizing, it would at least be nice to not have to pay to go as well. So, before we get off this call, can I have everyone I was trying to find the chat, not interrupt you. Can everyone commit to getting your 15 minute presentations whether you and and Stephen can get together? Just give me your parts and know your parts and know when to come in. It's not completely scripted. It's just kind of a guideline to go by. You already know your project so you can talk about it. And like you said, Sean, you know, you've had difficulty speaking in the past. So, this will help you, you know, having that guideline. So, um that's one thing. And then Pierce, I mean, we have to submit all of this to them, however we do it. So, I kind of like to get we we're under the gun with the X space, so we need to focus on that and the America Fest accommodations. Yeah. The nice thing about Airbnbs is is food is cheaper because it's much cheaper to like order a pizza or make spaghetti or whatever in an Airbnb is to like go out like every night for days and days. Oh, and breakfast. You can get up in the breakfast. You can to have breakfast. You can be in your pajamas. You can have coffee and you can buy a dozen eggs when you get there and like make eggs, right? Eggs and some butter and you're done. Yeah. Hey, where is It's got to be in Tucson, right? Uh, no, it's Phoenix. Oh, Phoenix. Yeah, I believe the event the uh America Fest is going to be in the convention center. So, um yeah, I have to dig it. I I'll do the the leg work. I have some experience doing this. So, I'll cut out a little bit of the the um it'll it maybe be a little bit easier for me to do this because I've done this about 20 times. Sorry. Um so, and I'll I'll share with y'all what I figure out and some ideas for Airbnbs and I'll still look into hotel room blocks for um everyone else that's showing up and we'll we'll have to balance how that works. Uh but what I'll do is I'll try to balance it between uh where the Airbnbs are, where the hotels are, where the conference room space, at least what they advertise. Um and so that when the uh America Fest event starts that perhaps we can actually walk there. That would be put that into AI and get a general itinerary of what would be, you know, locally negative writer. I mean, I'm always asking. I'm not trusting AI to something that critical. Yeah, that's that's not something AI. Listen, listen. I didn't mean, oh, yes. I mean, if it saved you some time and you'd be like, hey, that's not a bad idea, but I love what you're Yes, let's do this. Yes. I would have to double check. You said early, right? Probably would be crap. So, I've tried this occasionally in the past. No doubt that sometime in the future it will get better at that. um you know something like Expedia or something will have some kind of super duper agent that can do it but uh so far you know I haven't seen anything that even comes close the website should have should have suggestions should it not is that not a part two hotel suggestions but like a lot of these things they have a prior relationship with those hotels and at some point sooner than later they're going to get sold out u now there's um somewhat I've had good and bad experiences doing something like that. Um, getting in early, getting a room block at one of the official hotels um because usually they're closest, but also it can be somewhat distracting as well because there's a lot more people there. So, um, it's very it could become very competitive to like get a room and then hold it. Um, I've had people steal my rooms before because um, you know, more people or they it's Microsoft the hotel is like, "Oh, well, I just booted you because you're just some dude." No, that's happening or you're some small startup. So, that's a very mixed bag. That's happening with corrupt hotels. that happened with Queen Bee Beyonce where people had gotten the cheaper rate, booked their hotels, and then they went and cancelled them. And then they try to blame they try to blame Booking.com and Booking.com, uh, we're not having it. We know what you were doing. But somebody comes in and books a whole, they're gonna do they're going to bend over backwards for them. They're going to give them everything they want because they just Yeah. next year. I'm looking at the website right now. Right. And um I'm looking at the tickets and it and just FYI, it's 20 20,000 last year at this event. So I would imagine it's going to be at least that size again. So the likelihood of some larger companies rolling in because you know it's a big opportunity to sell um booking up a one of these hotels is only $25. Well, uh, for kids, I think it's 50 for adults. It Listen, I just said that it's $50 for adults 27 and older, 18 to 26, which is what Mark was talking about getting the younger generation is $25. So, we need to make sure we let people know that. But I think if we can raise the money to get a round of 10, remember we talked about give the giveaway for the ticket. I don't know that we will have those secured in two weeks, but if we could, you know, but we got to get our stuff secured first. So maybe that's something we can think of. And the X spaces, is that something we're going to commit to weekly? Like we pretty much have to do we have to have a certain amount of Right now it's monthly, but I think if if we do a good job um then perhaps we'll have negotiating power to team Doge to do it more often. So, um, yeah, but, uh, right now we're just planning on doing it monthly. Um, and yeah, that's what Gardner was saying that you guys wanted to do it monthly. Uh, we could do it probably more often. Um, and we could we could do repeats. Um, I mean, we I guess it it somewhat depends on I mean, if if we wanted to do somewhat of a of a repeat and just kind of slightly updated of what's going on with America Fest and what we're planning on doing, that might get boring for the people that aren't planning on joining us in America Fest. Um but uh let's we'll let's right now figure out how hard this is and how much of production value and then we could figure out how to do it more often. We can Sean can we highlight look let's figure out different episodes right like Stephen was saying figure out different episodes which people can highlight people will want to bring their project that ties in. So every episode after the first episode, the premiere episode has to be fully focused on America Fest plus the two projects, getting to know who the core people are. The second monthly episode, which people will start having spin-off spaces, we're I'm going to start launching these uh Google Meet calls. I just need time to get it together. So I think once a month is fantastic because it's hard to get people to meet all together and this broadcast is important and it will spin off to more. So after the premiere the hour and a half if we say after that we're going to go an hour after that every hour and a half always highlight the America Fest until we get to America Fest then we'll be highlighting the main project that we're working on after that. whether it's going to another event like that, whether you're hosting something, we're hosting something, whatever is happening. And you said every six months, so we're always running to that six month mark, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yep. I think that's a good target at least that keeps everyone kind of on on focus and we don't get too flowery, you know, talking about saving the world and [ __ ] like that. I mean, it's it's contagious and easy to do. Um but uh if we're f if we're only thinking about the next 6 months, you know, what's practical, what we can do, um then it has a tendency to, you know, tighten us up a little bit as far as our expectations. Um and that's and it I think generally that hopefully less likely to set off [ __ ] meters for people where they, you know, feel like it's unrealistic what you're planning. So

uh you're on mute, Regina. I do that on purpose because I'll I'll I know that it can be distracting when I'm agreeing. So, I need to start Stephen knows how I am. I have to mute myself out. They they have to mute me out sometimes. So, I'm cool with that. You're muting yourself because you're I love it. Regina, you're a trip. Um I'm actually gonna go, guys. Um I got to do another vacation. Let's um vote on what I should work on next for the seni. So there these are the four choices. So I I've kind of ground on the on the grants and stuff as much as I can. Oh, she left already. Oh well. Um yeah, she said she jet. I mean she's on vacation. I'm surprised she joined as much she did. Okay, so the next four choices are I can work on um Oh, you're talking about next episode choices. No. Uh next choices for what I work on in the um seni. Okay, so the next steps are there's four uh I have to add more data now. So uh I can work on integrating packs political action committees and seeing where contributions have gone. I can iterate on consultants uh because recently Aravella advisors and this would be a different source for generating Sena because they are like these group of lefty lawyers that uh run uh a bunch of these um NOS's. Okay. Uh then the third one is addresses. I could integrate addresses and zip codes uh into there and do like a link to a Google Street View. So you could go see, oh, let's go look at this this chair. Okay. Last one would be people and being able to look up NOS's by people. You can kind of do that with Data Republican with a lot of work or with ProPublica because you can search for people and ProPublica and then get the EIN and then funnel that back to um the the Seni. And that reminds me since Stephven's on the call, uh, a fifth one would be, um, the USA spending is kind of hard to get EIN's out of, but if I get the addresses, then maybe I can get that back into USA spending, but I don't know how to do that. Well, um, Jennica has some stuff on data the regular site cross referencing addresses with USA spending. Yeah, from you can get the ueI from USA spending. Uh, but that's not the EIN. It's not. Yeah. What's it? Is that a government ID? Yes, that's the government registration basically. What was the acronym again? UEI. UEI. Employment identification number. Eiification number. Yeah, that's a so whenever you corporation because everybody has employees, but all the grants go to a UEI, whatever the UEI uh stands for and that's that's the gap of like it's not quite that easy to say, oh UI is a unique entity ID. That's uh Yeah. Yeah. So those are on SAM.gov. Uh,

sorry about that. Yeah, we can. So, if it's if it's a legitimate company, we can get the address. So, yeah, they have to the the NOS's have to print out the address. I'm just not storing it right now. So, if I go and store it, then it's easy to feed it in to Google Street View and say, "Show me this address." And then we'll do that. Right. Yeah, that's always Google problem how much data to actually put into the the database or to put into the JSON. It's a everlasting problem. Can't do everything. Yeah. And we don't have a back end in the Republican which is by choice. So yeah. Yeah. I I started there but I just um I made a sacrifice to go to um uh uh to um Postgress to speed things up. Yeah. Um, but yeah, it's definitely not as flexible as JSON. I can't just um grind away at the data like I used to. Um, okay. Uh, what was the fourth thing I didn't quite grasp? It was something about EIN's. I didn't quite understand what you meant. Oh, the uh fourth thing was people and then the the uh the the ueI was a uh a fifth thing. Um but um Stephen kind of told me I can't really do that. Um this is I heard gr I was writing it down. Grants integrate PAC consultants then integrate again. I think that's what you're talking about the EIN and the UEIN and USA spending. Yeah, it'd be nice to go directly to USA spending because data republicans data is a little stale. I mean, I put a link in there that you can go to any charity and if you hit command and bring up that that charity, you can say, "Oh, show me the grants." And it'll show you all the grants that she has from USA spending. But it'd be nice to go right to USA spending and say, "Here's all the money the US government gave them, and this is what it gave them for." Yeah, that's data. Um, yeah, that that would be Yeah, that would be really a sexy topic for me, but I don't think it'd be interesting for anybody else. That's very much an operational issue of how aggressive to keep updating the data sources um for uh for for our sites. But yeah, not very sexy for the general public, I think.

Um, okay. Uh, wait a minute. Can I ask a question? Because I I'm representing the person that's going to come in that's listening that may kind of understand. So, what you're saying is, did I understand this correctly? So, you were talking about the data republican site or whatever that the information is it not real time? Is it not updating in real time? Am I missing the whole boat here? But that's what you want people to be able to get the most I thought that's what this was about was people getting the most upto-date recent information and if there's a way to do that. Is it sticky ground? Like what's going on here? I'm confused. Oh yeah. No, it's not. It's not real time. Uh presumably USA spending is real time. Steve would know for sure. He's evidently spent more time on it than I have. Uh but um I know the charity data, those are basically their tax returns. So, those aren't as fresh and sometimes they don't file for a year or they're behind or whatever. And um and even then they only the IRS only releases it in batches like once a month. So, I have a script that says, "Oh, go to the IRS website and download all the latest files and then it unzips them and then processes them and then so on." I have a like a do everything that SH script. Now the thing I am not doing is I'm not saving the addresses of the NOS's which is just mildly interesting. I mean as a human you can say oh show me this address and then show me this address to this one. You're like hey these are the same building. What's going on? Or hey this is a mailboxes etc. What's going on? Right? Like this is dodgy. Right? I've seen some data publican post where she's like oh here's this random building out in North Carolina that has 10 NOS's in it. And so it'd be interesting to like go from addresses. Another thing would be going from addresses to like, oh, here's all the charities at this address, you know, and I could do some analysis on that. So that would be interesting. Uh consultants is another one where these NOS's are like a clear layer of grift because all these NOS's are using like a same set of services. So these services are getting money from the NGO which is getting money from the government. So basically they're leeches, right? And Arabel Advisors is one where like Bill Gates just decided he's not going to give any money to Arabel Adviserss anymore because they were too corrupt. And if Bill Gates thinks they're too corrupt, got to be really bad, you know. Okay. Can I can I make my vote for for Pier? Oh, yeah. This whole thing you have to vote, right? No, I want you to do the consultants one offgate. I mean, I like the USA spending one, but the consultants one for the first show. Is that something that you would be interested in doing or is there something you prefer over that? Well, I don't think enough time. Let's see. Yeah, I like the vibe coding or uh excuse me, the for the show. This is what I'm going to be coding on separately. I mean, I have to presentation for how to do the vibe coding, but I think I could use whatever we choose as an example of like here's the vibe coding and I could go record myself doing it and say, "Oh, this is what I want you to do. Here I am doing and I'm running the Python script. Grind, grind, grind, grind, grind. Oh, look, here's the data. But it I I think to both of your points, um this could be exactly what we do some of the um if we were to go more uh more consistently like uh bi-weekly or weekly. Um, we could do a half hour to an hour show just on one of these topics and take questions from the general public on like, you know, what's up with the addresses and and Pierce could talk more in detail about um, you know, something interesting like that of how his decision- making of why he didn't include addresses in the first place and he's planning on doing it now and why USA spending um, has some of the data, but some of the data is someplace house and what he has to do to stitch the data together to find that a corporation for example has or an address has 10 corporations or more. Yeah. A tip I figured out which is zip code and name. Yeah. Get you most of the way there because you know the and sometimes you get zip code and a PO box and that's like gold, right? It's like right this must be this company. Half the half the words match, you know, and it's not really even that hard to code, right? Yeah. that that could be something interesting. Um probably more for the developers um that uh the way that we're doing pattern matching um across different projects because that's somewhat some of the magic sauce of making some of this stuff work. Uh, for instance, there's uh probably about 26 to about 26 different public data sources, government data sources for California state government. I'm I'm pulling four right now. Um, and it's a shitload of work. Um, I probably should be pulling one or more important ones like grants database. I'm not pulling right now. Um, but it's a lot of work to stitch them together and the state hasn't done any of the effort even though you would think they would do that, you know, for financial analysis and keeping their books straight, but they don't care. They run each of these groups completely separately. So um cross referencing you know h what the headcount is for a particular um and their expectation of headcount for budget over the next couple years with what was actually spent to what groups are um you know spending money and submitting POS to different similar but different departments in the state. They don't do that. But I've tried I've made a really valiant effort to try to stitch that data together and I'm pattern matching on stuff like what Pierce is saying on not necessarily zip codes but names um company uh company names people's names uh uh uh project names things like or even sometimes codes and trying to stitch those things together so that when somebody goes searching using my tool they can actually come up with an interesting result which starts to present all these different possible not 100% sure they're accurate but probably 90% accurate of all these different things organizations and people that are getting money on this one topic like healthcare or I don't know I don't know variety of different things um equity is a is an interesting one or or tide center you know so uh so they could go searching in basically use our tools to do deeper research. It's we do some tactical research um just to kind of validate. Um we probably should build some tests that actually go out and do it. Um but that's one of the things I haven't had time to. I doubt Pierce had the time to do it either. That'd be really cool. But um but we really rely on human beings to go out and use our tools and to um find out stuff and then to give us feedback. said, "Oh, wouldn't it be cool if you added the street address or wouldn't it be cool if you know you added Google Maps or something?" I I don't know. I'm just making [ __ ] up now. Yeah. Can you help me update that form for because I wanted to add a subsection under the engineering like I need to learn how to do that if I can learn it just by simply watching video. Um, and I did send you a message on it, but I know you were in meetings, so I wanted to just jump that in there. I know that you're talking about something different, but I love what you're doing. Like I mean you're teaching people how to do basic stuff that seems overwhelming and scary and it's scary to me. That's why I haven't really jumped in and done a whole lot on that end of it. It's a form of data science really. I mean um it's not as sophisticated as um what most people like if they come out with a university degree on data science. Um but um what we're doing essentially is we're um we're organizing known data sources in such a way where folks can do research and u that is you know some most the aspects of doing data science. There's um obviously much more elegant if you have a university degree in doing these things um of how to store data and how to collate data. But um but that's that's essentially what we're getting closer and closer to is for government data data and corporate data sources. We're helping the general public do data science which is an interesting thing we're trying to do. It's almost like an experiment, a moving experiment. So, but the more and more as people get more sophisticated using AI tools for various things, it's becomes more and more possible, you know, where 1015 years ago, people just kind of talked about it and reporters did some of this work very superficially usually, but um in no way did they get this deep. I mean, they just didn't have access to this kind of information um because they just didn't have the time or the expertise to to dig into the data like we can.

Uh but yes, I'd be happy to help you with um updating the form. Um uh so I think if I have someone sitting with me that can show me step by like I was trying to follow directions. I took Pierce's advice. Um, but again, you said you don't trust chat GBT, but it laid out like and I was like, "What the [ __ ] That's not my favorite." Right. What the hell is this? So, I don't know what I'm doing, but I definitely want to be able to help you out in that respect. Sure. And um Yeah. And then for my own website, too. Like, I'm in this competition for host, co-host. I want to be able to put my platforms and different, you know, like my menu and stuff, but I don't care about my website right now. I care about getting this done and um learning how to get in there and do stuff because that's the whole basis so that I can say, "Hey, I learned. If I can learn, anyone can learn if you have the time to put into it, right? Don't sell yourselves short." But I I think I know what you're saying. Um yeah, more than happy to help. Um one thing I wanted to mention before um it's getting we've been here for a bit, so probably start losing more people. Um, if anybody else wanted me um to add um projects to the carousel on the Doge or the I I guess it's the the Doge Network website. Um I named it the Conservative Technology Group, but oh um I guess it's technically both. Um so I added uh uh California Doge and Regina's site. So, if you guys get to the point where you feel comfortable adding yours, just let me know and I'm happy to add it. Um, easy to do. Yeah. And in a couple weeks, I should have at least five episodes in the can that I can start my segment on my platforms for conservative, whatever that title was, Doge Cal, Doge Network, all of it. I know, I know it sounds disrespectful for me to say I don't remember, but a lot of information is coming in. Disrespectful. So um to keep straight yeah but I plan to make that as a segment and that can be incorporated in as well. So where you know Pierce comes on and we talk about the projects that he's doing. Stephen comes on and we talk about what he's been doing. You come on and we talk about what you've been doing pre-record all of it. So give me Yeah. Give me a couple weeks to put some stuff together. Um, and uh, because I've been trying I I had interviewed a bunch of people and I was like, how the hell am I gonna so more like a podcast rather than a a space, right? It's all the way and I'm involved in the space, too. So everybody has an outlet to go and be a part of it whether it's web two and I I hope to bring it into web three also because there's a lot of great web 3 people that are integrating web two into web 3 just for this type of thing. Okay. Yeah. Well, if we if we record some stuff and broadcast it at different times, maybe we could get more of an audience as well. So Okay, cool. Um, so, uh, did you, um, Stephen and Pierce, did you guys, um, un did you follow me offering to add the projects? I wasn't sure if I said that right or you guys understood what I meant. Did you hear that, Stephen? You put yourself on and I I didn't get an a vote from everybody on the the five things. Oh, you wanted vote and see how it goes. Okay. Okay. So, who is interested in seeing what packs get contributed to from NOS's? Okay. Uh, are you doing hands? Yeah. Okay. Oh, wait. That's the wrong kind of hand. Uh, okay. Three the road for that. Okay. Who's interested in doing consultants next? I think consultants consultants and that those two kind of go together in a way, don't they? Yeah. I just don't political thing and the other one's just Arabel advisers and people that are the the leeches. Yeah. Give us the choices again. Okay. You have uh tracking down contribution from packs. I have to see if that's actually a thing, too. Uh consultants. I know that's a thing. um addresses and zips to feed into Google Street View and possibly do other matching and trying to have like a people access where you can put in people's name and go to the charities they're affiliated with. I kind of have some of that on the presets for the billionaires. And then the last thing is working out some the EIN to UEI mapping with Stephen. I vote for the pack and the Google the associating the address with the it they they were right there following each other. I think it was the third and the fourth one. Okay. Yeah. You don't have to give them by number. You can just tell me which one I'm trying. It was the one where you Okay. the the pack one and then the Google map location thing tying the address with the was it the zip code or all of that. Yeah, I'll take it to Google Street View. So Google Street View that one that one in the pack is my vote. Oh, that matches the other one. Yeah. And I'll probably be able to find matches like this is the address where a thousand charities live, you know, or something like that, right? That'll be interesting. Okay. Yeah, there's a lot of that. I think that's uh people will be interested in that because I I know for a fact we did an expose with Walter Kurt about a woman in Northern Virginia. She has like four or five businesses registered at the same office and they're all scam. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think that is um I think I could go both try to split my brain into two like what would I think be more interesting to the public and I think that is super interesting. Um the the engineering me likes the the consultants and the cross referencing that's more sexy to me but um I I doubt that's as interesting to other people. So, no, the consulting and the the the go Google location street maps definitely because the consultant listen those are the two sexy ones I think and I said the path but that's I mean I say the consultants and the Google map locations for now. Okay, good. I think you have winners. Yeah. Okay, awesome. Um so um I I think it would be helpful um and uh I can uh do some uh X broadcasting on this as well. And this this is why I was mentioning putting projects on the front of the site basically to um to show um in a very visual way who's who's showing up, you know, who's committed to doing the America Fest thing. So if you guys are interested in um like attaching your project um to that so that it starts showing up visually um I actually the site I created for Regina I um created a link so it comes up with her picture and it rotates through and somebody clicks on it and it actually goes to her site. So, I could do the same for y'all's projects, but um but also um I could do something similar to anybody who's interested in in uh kind of being affiliated and is definitely planning on showing up to America Best. And may I just make a small request that Pearson Steven tap into that carousel because when I start doing content promoting and videos and stuff like that, I'll be able to show where they can go directly from the website. I'll also show where to find you on platforms. It does. Yeah. See a picture, click on it. Yeah. Um, one of the things I wanted to I think maybe I offered Stephen or uh maybe I didn't. I forgot if I had or not, but u I noticed you had kind of a generic website set up for essentially your your identity. Um, I created a a slightly more sophisticated website for Regina. Um, I can do the same for you if you're interested. Um, doesn't doesn't take you have more stuff on your website to offer. You've got your merch and all that. You need to take him up on this offer. Well, yeah, it it's a standing offer. If anybody wants help setting up basic sites, I'm more than happy to do it. Um, does it cost back? Yeah, let me circle back. Yeah, no problem. That Yeah, no problem. Yeah, because I I got too much stuff going on and uh I just uh transitioned to a management role with my new company. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of things. Yeah. Thank you. A lot of things I'm in the process of learning because they use different systems. Got it. Yeah. So, okay. That's why I'm like very extremely busy and uh I don't get off work until like 9 10 o'clock at night. just when you're ready, Stephen. When you're ready. It's a great offer. And and really, it was done before. He was like, "Here's your website." I was like, "What?" And I went on there and it's really simple. So, when you're ready, just there's no rush. I know you got a lot going. Did you attach your website to your uh uh page? I did. Okay. I need to check it out because I haven't checked it. Yeah. Now, listen, don't get mad. I mean, like I said, you have more things to offer, but I was working with this and he's going to show me how to put stuff up there. But when I ask him, he's like, "Yeah, I got it." And he takes care of it. So, like, it's really cool because people know that you're associated with America Fest and you kind of need to be on the website. There's really nothing you need to do. He just does it. And then when you have time, you know, but you have that website, he could do this. But plus, it'll give you that dogeetwork.org website, which the.org is important to me. I know that sounds stupid, but I really like the affiliation with it. So, just think about it. check out my website, but don't judge me because there's different styles you can choose. Yeah, I can I can tweak it certainly. It's it's a I picked the most simple like uh I love the way he laid it out. The about the fact I mean he had everything in there. Like I didn't have to I was like, "Oh my god." I I mean I stared at it for two days straight. Thank you. I've had people sign up like people are signing up like stuff like that. It's really cool. That's awesome. Yeah. I'm I'm happy to see that that what I need to do what I need to do is I need to actually open a substack and start uploading all of my exposees over there. Yeah. Yeah. Monetize them. That's smart. Yeah. And monetize them. Yep. Well, that that's one of the things having a website could help um that as a jumping off point. So, it's super easy to people to find and they don't have to go searching for your Substack. It's just a link. All your stuff is in one place, Stephen. And schools might school might be another that application where you can sell training. You can monetize through I'm working with two ladies that we're going to start a thing on howto courses and it's like a $10 a month subscription. I don't know how it's going to work, but we're going to figure it out. I swear I never do something like that, but why not? And like he's saying, that one website will be a landing place for all your stuff. Yeah, that's that's what it's intended to be, you know, because it it really more I think for Regina, what it really more is an access point for people to get to her YouTube. Um, so it's a easy place for people to find her YouTube so she can monetize on that. Yeah. Plus my page with the services that I offer, I'm working on that too, like for editing and stuff like that. So if you have site, you need to get like a a deck of I I can do this service. It's so much an hour. I can look into this. And I don't know if you could do that with what you do now, but I'm just saying it's a it's a it's a website where you could put your services. You could put your platforms. Like it's really cool. Yeah. Yeah, I think what I'm going to do first before we do the website, I need to build the substack and start uploading stuff and I'll back to you and be like, "Hey, uh, can you build a website so I can attach my Aladdin merch and the substack to it and that way people can uh then just put that link and it will be all in there." Yeah, that's a good plan. Yep, that's a good plan. Um, yeah, it um I intentionally made it very simple. I've found um from doing pitches uh for uh funding for various startups that um if you add too much um and actually people get confused much like um TLDDR for long emails. If you if you make it 10 pages long, they're going to look at one or two and then just be like, "Oh, that's enough." So, if you keep it simple on target and you know, if you want to highlight your YouTube or your Substack, you just you put that right in the front. Yeah, that guy with the 120 page presentation about why the Cracker Barrel rebrand was going to suck. If he had just crazy breakfast before and the breakfast after, it was like that's all he needed to do. But he on and on about like how every one of the board members was an idiot and it's like, yeah, no, you didn't see me say that, dude. I mean, that's the ultimate TLDDR. I mean, holy [ __ ] 120. I actually had a boss at Yahoo that um would do that. He would he used powerpoints as like uh like a mind map like a early version. So everything that he was thinking about and all his notes were all jammed into this PowerPoint presentation. It was insane. It was like an accidental look into his subconscious and he would bring it up in like these VP level meetings and and pan through it and it was wow. It was visually abusive and it was like that. It was like 120 pages of just this really dense uh all his thoughts and nobody had any idea what the hell he was talking about. So yeah, one page, one or two pages much much more effective at getting your point across. So anyway, um we lost Regina. So uh was there anything else we wanted to touch on or uh I really appreciate you guys time all you need from us today? Yeah, I got uh I got stuff for work to do. Uh time sheets and all that stuff I need to approve. Right on. Yeah. So, okay, man. Thanks for joining us. Yeah. Thank you so much. Appreciate it, guys. Yep. See you next week, hopefully. Yep. See you. Yep. Have a good weekend. Thank you. Yeah, you too, bro. Later. Bye, guys.

I'm so sorry I had to run to the ladies. You're in. No, no, it's all good. We lost the boys. Um I I kind of let them off because it's it's been over an hour already, so it's a long time. Uh do you want to go over the Let me stop the recording. else is following this. Let's see if I can stop this. If if you want to leave it going, leave it going. That way I can use it if you're going to show me how to do this. Oh, okay. Sure. You got it. Um, let me hold on one second. Let me I'm gonna have to because I can't do a share screen with You know what? Can you switch from this and come into StreamYard? Um, I can. Yeah, sure. Yeah, let's do that. Let me get into the yard because that way I'll be able to do my share screen and I'll be able to Do you want to keep this going or You can keep it going. That's fine, too. Whatever is easiest for Well, no, no. I mean, uh we'll we'll be doing we'll be on another video cam, so I should probably shut this down. Okay. Yeah. All right. Sounds good. I'll see you in a minute. Come through the same link. Do you still have it or you want me to send it to you again?
