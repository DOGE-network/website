# How to DOGE Your State: A Practical Guide

This “how to” lays out a playbook for launching and sustaining a transparent, open government data initiative in alignment with the DOGE Network’s mission, using proven open source community practices, and adopting a technical stack for both frontend visualization and backend ETL.

***

### Purpose and Mission

**DOGE Network** empowers states and citizens to create transparent government data ecosystems, transforming fragmented public data into accessible, actionable insights while fostering decentralized, community-driven oversight and accountability. Every state project must champion open, participatory engagement and ensure compliance with public licensing, branding, and community agreements. The aim is to create a replicable model for transparent, efficient government through data liberation and visual storytelling.

***

### Project Structure

#### Frontend

- **Starter template:** Clone and customize the [cali_doge repository] as your state’s frontend UI and data visualization starter. Each state gets its own repo under the DOGE-network GitHub organization.
- **Hosting:** Use Vercel for fast deployment and accessibility. Structure code and documentation for easy contributor onboarding.
- **Visualizations:** Adapt modular dashboards, interactive charts, and transparency features to highlight high-value public data.

#### Backend

- **Data ETL:** Each state’s backend project focuses on collecting, extracting, and transforming raw government data from disparate sources (HTML, PDF, CSV, TSV, etc.). Clone and customize the [cali_data_pipeline repository] as your state’s data pipeline starter. Each state gets its own repo under the DOGE-network GitHub organization.
    - **Extract:** Use scripts (PyMuPDF for PDFs, Playwright for scrapes, native libraries for CSV/TSV) to gather and parse data.
    - **Transform:** Normalize to JSON. Each transformation step should be scripted, reproducible, and well documented.
    - **Load:** Then load into a relational structure for Postgres.
- **Organization:** Automate regular updates, version archives, and maintain a public changelog. Backend scripts are organized by state, remaining inside the DOGE-network org for now.

***

### Open Source Community Practices

#### Onboard Contributors

- **Open to Contributions:** Encourage external contributors by maintaining public repos, clear contribution guidelines, and open communications.
- **Foster Creativity:** Let contributors suggest features, sources, and visualizations. Use GitHub Discussions, Issues, or a dedicated forum for open brainstorming.
- **Facilitate Success:** Assign onboarding buddies, offer clear READMEs, and use project boards to consolidate tasks. Make the onramp simple (one-click deploy guides, simple code structure, etc.).

#### Workflow and Governance

- **Centralize Workflow:** Keep all collaboration in one place (GitHub: code, issues, pull requests, PR templates). Maintain a discussion forum or Slack/Discord for real-time engagement.
- **Enforce Project Agreements:** All DOGE Network and Public Data Network repos adhere to common mission, public licensing, and branding. Set clear escalation steps for violations: warning, sanctions, expulsion if serious.
- **Governance Phasing:** Start flat and lightweight—bring in more formal committees only if/when scale, contributors, or legal issues require it.

#### Branding and Outreach

- **Consistent Messaging:** Use the DOGE Network style guide for all public-facing docs, UIs, and social posts.
- **Community Engagement:** Share wins, milestones, and new data sources through GitHub releases, newsletters, and social media. Recognize and celebrate contributions.

| Layer    | What to Use                                              | Guidance/Tools                                       |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Frontend | UI (per-state fork)                                       | React-based, open issues for state-custom dashboards  |
| Backend  | ETL pipeline (per-state fork)                            | PyMuPDF (PDF), Playwright (web), csv/tsv libs, Postgres |
| Repository  | GitHub Organization (DOGE-network)                       | Public, rigorous code review, CI/CD if possible      |
| Hosting | Vercel project                                              | DOGE-Network managed for public deployment|

### Escalation and Enforcement

All project participants must adhere to community guidelines and organizational agreements. Violations trigger escalating responses—starting with a warning, then restrictions, with expulsion as the last resort.

***

### Appendix: Launch Checklist

- [ ] Fork and customize cali_doge for your state’s needs
- [ ] Research and collect high-value data sources (HTML, PDF, CSV, TSV, etc.)
- [ ] Build ETL scripts to extract, transform, normalize, and load
- [ ] Open source all code and scripts under the DOGE-network GitHub org
- [ ] Communication through X channels for community onboarding
- [ ] Segment backend for migration to Public Data Network as needed
- [ ] Regularly celebrate milestones and contributors
