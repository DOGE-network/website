### Conservative Technology Group (CTG) Early Draft

### Overview

We individually are supporting various projects related to government transparency. While these are generally passion projects that we would do for free, it would be nice to get collaboration across many similar projects to help push forward. For that purpose, we have decided to start meeting in person. Possible outcome could be to form a nonprofit organization to help with organizing and supporting projects. It would be self organizing and classified as a 501(c) for federal tax purposes.
